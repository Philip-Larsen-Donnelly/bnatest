# Opportunities and Challenges

## Opportunities

1.  Planning and organising the BNA implementation will ensure by-in
    from Ministry of Health for usability and sustainability of the
    bottleneck application.
2.  Development and implementation of bna  will trigger national
    interest, leading to greater use of DHIS2 at district and national
    levels
3.  Bottleneck and causal analysis are useful for evidence based
    planning and can be used as a tools for resource mobilization.
4.  Aligning health program interventions to the already existing
    national planning cycles and systems during  the planning process.
    This will

    1.  Foster Government buy in
    2.  Build local ownership
    3.  Lower costs of implementation.

## Challenges

1.  Scheduling BNA activities within the national calendar will
    sometimes become challenging causing delays in reaching consensus.
2.  Infrastructure requirements such as internet in some districts may
    delay the implementation.
