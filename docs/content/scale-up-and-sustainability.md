# Scale-up and sustainability

Beginning with a pilot is often good as it provides guidance on areas
that need most attention. Piloting provides cost estimates that can be
used for scaleup projections. Below some factors to consider for scaling
up implementation of the bottleneck analysis;

1.  Availability of technical support: The BNA App is currently
    supported by UiO/HISP nodes in east africa. This support is critical
    to build local capacity for customization, maintenance, and quality
    assurance
2.  Community engagements should be aligned to already existing
    community structures to ensure sustainability
3.  Political and technical district leadership is necessary to
    influence real change in the communities
