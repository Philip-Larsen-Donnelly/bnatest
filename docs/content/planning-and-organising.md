# Planning and organising

## Identify stakeholders and structures needed

It is important to identify the stakeholders who will participate in the
implementation of BNA App and associated activity. Key stakeholders may
include but not limited to the Ministry of Health, district staff,
Unicef staff, development and implementing partners.

A BNA Core Team (BCT) of 3-5 people will need to be identified and given
the roles and responsibilities of administering the bottleneck app. The
core team support setup and configuration will participate in testing
and training activities, organizing and supporting end-user in various
groups.

A technical Steering committee, composed of Unicef and MoH will be
needed to coordinate the BNA implementation across various health
programs (Malaria, nutrition, reproductive health etc). The committee
will lead integration efforts and make decisions regarding the overall
architecture and functioning of the app.

## Integration efforts

The functionality of BNA relies mostly on data from legacy systems
within the health sector. It is important to assess and consider efforts
required for integration and data exchange that needs to be conducted.
The leading principle for this work should be to create a
decision-driven and indicator-focused system

## Infrastructure (Equipment and Internet)

1.  An assessment needs to establish the needs for hardware and software
    needs at district level to support BNA usability. Availability of
    desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones all have different
    qualities, and typically a mix of these different technologies will
    need to be supported.
2.  Server and hosting alternatives needs to be critically examined with
    regards to capacity, infrastructural constraints, legal framework,
    security and confidentiality issues.
3.  Internet connection for all users will be needed. Mobile internet
    will be adequate for the majority of users doing data collection and
    regular analysis.
4.  Options for mobile phone users, bulk sms deals etc, should be
    examined if appropriate and a decision taken by management.

## Rollout strategies

The rollout team needs to give thought to scale-up of the bottleneck
app, following Â a successful testing phase. The rollout should consider
sustainability efforts including support within the MoH structure.

1.  The core team will play a key role here and each member should have
    clear responsibilities for the roll-out covering: user support, user
    training, liaison with health programs, etc.
2.  Broader support structures need to be established to provide
    support, supervision, and communication with global/regional network
    of expert users and developers.
3.  Information use must be a focus area from the start and be a
    component both in the initial system design and the first round of
    user training.
4.  District review meetings and or equivalent should be supported with
    appropriate BNA information packages and training.
5.  Training will typically be the largest investment over time, and
    necessitates structures for continuous opportunities. Plan for a
    long term training approach catering for a continuous process of
    enabling new users and new system functionalities.
6.  Supervision and follow-ups on actions agreed upon should be
    prioritized.
