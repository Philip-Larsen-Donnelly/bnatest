# Capacity building

## National Core Team (NCT)

The National core team will need all the necessary skills to support BNA
app implementation and bottleneck analysis in general. Both user and
technical skills will be required in this case.

  - User skills (Ability to generate, analysis and interpret BNA charts,
    enter root causes for identified gaps, etc),
  - Technical Skills (know how to setup BNA indicators on charts,
    configure user access and sharing)

## Training strategies

1.  The national core team should be prepared to offer continuous
    training to both national and district level users in accordance
    with BNA implementation guidelines.
2.  Focused group trainings should be adopted to allow maximum benefit
    for the participants. Sub-national level meetings such District
    Committee, District Health Management meetings should serve as
    avenues to discuss bottlenecks and mitigation approaches.
3.  The core team should routinely review, identify and share the
    feedback on BNA app use cases with the development teams at HISP and
    UiO.
4.  Training material and reference guides to reflect local information
    needs and local system content should be adopted. The core team
    should play a key role in ensuring training materials are up-to-date
    and conform to the country standards.
